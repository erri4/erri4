## About Me

Hi there! I'm a passionate and versatile developer with expertise in a wide range of technologies, including Python, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, git and PHP. I thrive on building innovative solutions and continuously learning new skills. Whether working on the backend, frontend, or full-stack.

Also, lastly i started learning C++ for my education in computer science. The "cpp" repo is just for me to backup my homework, but you can view and use the code in there.

Feel free to check out my repositories, and don't hesitate to reach out for collaborations or if you want to chat about coding!
